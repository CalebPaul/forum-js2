##Create a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers.
 * DONE Questions should have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes.
 * DONE Answers should have the content of the answer and the author.
 * DONE Include a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.
 * DONE List all questions on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing.
 * DONE  Users should be able to click on a question to view additional information.
 * DONE Allow users to add and edit questions.
 * DONE Allow users to add answers to a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
 * Implement at least one computed property.
 - Possible Ideas: Allow users to upvote the answer they think is best, then sort answers by number of upvotes. Or display the number of answers each question has with a computed property.
 * Add a helper.
 - Possible Ideas: Nicely-formatted timestamps on questions and/or answers, a formatting change or special icon for questions with no answers, or questions with large numbers of answers, a formatting change or special icon for the answer with the most upvotes, etc.
 * Integrate a service.
 - Possible Ideas: Allow users to create lists of favorite questions or answers to reference later.

##If you have completed the objectives for the code answer, consider adding some additional features:
 * DONE Add custom styling.

 * Add tags to questions.

##Your code will be answered for the following objectives:
 * DONE Application template contains header with link(s).
 * DONE Data is stored in and retrieved from Ember Data models and Firebase.
 * DONE Components are used to create display and behavior for your templates.
 * DONE One-to-many relationship exists between Question and Answers.
 * DONE Application works as expected.
 * DONE Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
 * Project demonstrates understanding of week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
